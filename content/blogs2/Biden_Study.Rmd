# Biden's Approval Margins

As we saw in class, fivethirtyeight.com has detailed data on [all polls that track the president's approval ](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-ratings)

```{r, cache=TRUE}
# Import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

#glimpse(approval_polllist)

approval_polllist_new <- approval_polllist %>%
                        mutate(modeldate_new = mdy(modeldate),
                        startdate_new = mdy(startdate),
                        enddate_new = mdy(enddate),
                        createddate_new = mdy(createddate))

#glimpse(approval_polllist_new)

```

## Create a plot

What I would like you to do is to calculate the average net approval rate (approve- disapprove) for each week since he got into office. I want you plot the net approval, along with its 95% confidence interval. There are various dates given for each poll, please use `enddate`, i.e., the date the poll ended.

Also, please add an orange line at zero.

```{r, Biden approval rating}
biden_ci <- approval_polllist_new %>% 
            #na.omit() %>% 
            select(adjusted_approve,adjusted_disapprove,enddate_new) %>% 
            mutate(week_of_year = week(enddate_new),
                   net_approval_margin = adjusted_approve- adjusted_disapprove) %>% 
            group_by(week_of_year) %>% 
            summarise(na.rm=TRUE, 
                      mean_approval_margin = mean(net_approval_margin),
                      sd_approval_margin = sd(net_approval_margin),
                      count = n(),
                      t_critical = qt(0.975,count-1),
                      se_approval_margin = sd(net_approval_margin)/sqrt(count),
                      margin_of_error = t_critical * se_approval_margin,
                      approval_margin_low = mean_approval_margin - margin_of_error,
                      approval_margin_high = mean_approval_margin + margin_of_error)

**Comment:**

We can observe how since he has come into office, Biden’s popularity has been steadily on the decline. This can be attributed to a number of factors. Firstly, the rise of the Delta variant has prolonged the return to normalcy in many American states. Secondly, Biden’s execution of the US military’s pullout from Afghanistan was viewed by many as badly mishandled. Both of these factors have meant that more US citizens now disapprove of rather than approve of him. 

## Compare Confidence Intervals:

The confidence intervals for week 3 and 25 respectively show the steady decrease in Biden’s approval rating. This can be attributed to the factors described above: mainly (1) The rise of the Delta variant; and (2) The US pullout out of Afghanistan.
