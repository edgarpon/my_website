# My Biography
My name is _Edgar Pon_ and I’m from Lisbon and Macao. I have completed my bachelor’s degree in **Economics** last year and I lived in _Portugal_, _Macao_ and _France_. I like a good balance between studying and partying and I enjoy having a good time, going out sometimes, having dinner and going to the pub. 
I am fluent in: 

* Portuguese
* Cantonese
* Mandarin 

In my free time, I enjoy watching (any kind of sports) and playing football, chess and board games.
